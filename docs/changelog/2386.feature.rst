Test environments now recognize boolean config keys ``constrain_package_deps`` (default=true) and ``use_frozen_constraints`` (default=false),
which control how tox generates and applies constraints files when performing ``install_package_deps``.

If ``constrain_package_deps`` is true (default), then tox will write out ``{env_dir}{/}constraints.txt`` and pass it to
``pip`` during ``install_package_deps``. If ``use_frozen_constraints`` is false (default), the constraints will be taken
from the specifications listed under ``deps`` (and inside any requirements or constraints file referenced in ``deps``).
Otherwise, ``list_dependencies_command`` (``pip freeze``) is used to enumerate exact package specifications which will
be written to the constraints file.

In previous releases, conflicting package dependencies would silently override the ``deps`` named in the configuration,
resulting in test runs against unexpected dependency versions, particularly when using tox factors to explicitly test
with different versions of dependencies - by :user:`masenf`.
